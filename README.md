The project of “Digital visitor counter” is based on the interfacing of some components such as sensors, motors etc. with arduino microcontroller. 
This counter can count people in both directions. 
This circuit can be used to count the number of persons entering a hall/mall/home/office in the entrance gate and it can count the number of persons leaving the hall by decrementing the count at same gate or exit gate and it depends upon sensor placement in mall/hall. 
It can also be used at gates of parking areas and other public places.
This project is divided in four parts: sensors, controller, counter display and gate. 
The sensor would observe an interruption and provide an input to the controller which would run the counter increment or decrement depending on entering or exiting of the person. 
And counting is displayed on a 16x2 LCD through the controller.
